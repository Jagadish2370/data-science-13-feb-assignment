    "    Specificity: Catch exceptions as specifically as possible. Avoid using a broad except clause that catches all exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use try-except Blocks Sparingly: Don't overuse try-except blocks for control flow. They should primarily be used for handling exceptional situations, not for regular program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Log Exceptions: Always log exceptions, along with relevant information, to aid in debugging and troubleshooting. Python's built-in logging module can be useful for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Avoid Bare except: Avoid using a bare except clause as it catches all exceptions, including system-exiting exceptions like SystemExit and \n",
    "    \n",
    "    KeyboardInterrupt. Catch only the exceptions you expect.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Handle Errors Locally: When possible, handle errors locally where they occur, rather than propagating them up the call stack unnecessarily.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Use else and finally Blocks: Utilize the else block to put code that should run if no exceptions were raised within the try block. Use the finally block for cleanup code that should always execute, regardless of whether an exception was raised."
